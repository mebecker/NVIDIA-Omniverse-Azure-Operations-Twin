## Prerequisites

1. AZ CLI
2. Certbot
3. OpenSSL
4. Kubectl
5. Kubelogin

Caveat - All of the automation was developed and tested in Ubuntu 24.04.01 running in WSL. There is nothing in the automation that specifically *requires* Linux, but running directly under Windows will likely require some modifications to commands, strings, etc.

## Deplyoment steps

1. Update all of the values in the json files in the ./bicep/paramaters/contoso folder as well the variables in /scripts/exports.sh

2. Login to AZ CLI, create resource group and deploy Key Vault, MSIs, and VNet.

    ```bash
    source ./scripts/exports.sh

    az login
    az group create --location $LOCATION --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
    az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --template-file ./bicep/step-1.bicep --parameters ./bicep/parameters/contoso/step-1.json  
    ```

3. Create certificates and upload to Key Vault

    You can generate your certificates however you please. Howeer, in order to configure Application Gateway and API Management, the certificates need to be uploaded into Key Vault in PKCS 12 format.

    If you have registered a domain and have control of DNS, you can use the "create-and-upload-certificates.sh" script that I have provided which will use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to generate free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates and upload them to the Key Vault that was created in step 2. This script takes a comma delimited list of FQDNs for which it will create *wildcard certificates.* If your requirements are different, feel free to modify as needed. Note that the script does a manual dns challenge for domain ownership verification. If you are familiar with how to set up certbot plugins, you can easily modify this to automate the verification.

    ```bash
    DOMAINS="" #comma-delimited list of domains for which to create and upload certificates. you should have one for the "front end" and one for the "back end"
    EMAIL="" #contact email for letsencrypt
    KEYVAULT_NAME="" #your key vault name

    ./certificates/create-and-upload-certificates.sh $DOMAINS $EMAIL $KEYVAULT_NAME
    ```

4. Deploy Application Gateway, APIM, AKS. This step will take a while (up to 45 minutes) since APIM takes a long time to deploy.

    ```bash
    az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --template-file ./bicep/step-2.bicep --parameters ./bicep/parameters/contoso/step-2.json
    ```

5. Deploy nginx-ingress-controller

    Update ./k8s/nginx-ingress-controller/values-internal.yaml 

    1. Set "service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group" to the managed resource group for your AKS cluster. You can get that via `az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --
query nodeResourceGroup`
    2. Set "service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet" to your AKS subnet
    3. Run the following commands

        ```bash
        az aks get-credentials --format azure --resource-group rg-nvidia --name aks-nvidia
        export KUBECONFIG=/home/${USER}/.kube/config
        kubelogin convert-kubeconfig â€“l azurecli

        helm upgrade -i nginx-ingress-controller-internal -n nginx-ingress-controller --create-namespace -f ./k8s/nginx-ingress-controller/values-internal.yaml bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller
        ```
